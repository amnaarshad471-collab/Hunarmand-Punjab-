          Hunarmand Punjab Strengthen the digital Economy through skills
          development & Youth Empowerment
        </h2>

        <p className="font-15 l-h-1">
          Hunarmand Punjab’s e-learning platform empowers low-income individuals
          by providing free access to digital skills and certifications,
          enabling employment and entrepreneurship. With 600,000+ IT
          professionals and 20,000 graduates entering the field annually,
          Pakistan has potential, but still faces a major skills gap.
          Initiatives like e-Rozgar have created over 126,000 jobs and supported
          1,300+ startups, showcasing the government's commitment to digital
          growth. E-learning reduces education costs, expands access, and
          directly addresses industry skill shortages. While Pakistan’s IT
          workforce is 500,000–700,000, the demand exceeds 2.5 million. Boosting
          skills through online platforms strengthens local industries, reduces
          reliance on foreign expertise, and can help grow Pakistan’s $3.5B IT
          sector closer to regional giants like India and China.
